# StokesFEM
This program simulates the velocity flow field in a 2D system in some simple
geometries. The flow is treated in the Stokesian limit. It should be noted that
some parts of the code originate of a [tutorial]{https://fenicsproject.org/docs/dolfin/latest/python/demos/stokes-iterative/demo_stokes-iterative.py.html}
by the people at FeniCS, because the code was largely built on their great
library. If you publish with their libary, please follow their
[guideline]{https://fenicsproject.org/citing/} on citing them.

Feel free to use the code to play with your systems. A good starting point for
your experimentation is probably the example.py file, which generates a simple
simulation. Please note that because this is a research code, I cannot
guarantee that any features will remain unchanged.
